## Description
This is implemented in SpringBoot and has postman collection also added in Github. I have also integrated with swagger so when you start the local server you should be able to see swagger document at link:
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#/transaction-controller

Also you can use postman to make a call for swagger document:
http://localhost:8080/v2/api-docs (Postman collection has this API too.)
